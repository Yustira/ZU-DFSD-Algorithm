# Zelibe Ugwuanyi And Different Standard Deviation Algorithm
By: Iyas Yustira, Dena Suprianto

Zelibe Ugwuanyi (ZU) and Different Standard Deviation (DFSD) is a new solution to solve the transportation problem. ZU method was introduced by Zelibe and Ugwuanyi (in 2019) to overcome the two stage process of standard solution which is tiring and time wasting becomes a one stage process. While, DFSD method was introduced by Ravi, Dickson, Akila and Sathya also in 2019. The algorithm is a unique way to reach the optimal solution without or with degeneracy conditions and directly find the optimal solution with minimum number of iterations.
