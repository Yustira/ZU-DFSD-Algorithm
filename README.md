By: Iyas Yustira, Dena Suprianto

Zelibe Ugwuanyi (ZU) and Different Standard Deviation (DFSD) is a new solution to solve the transportation problem. Zelibe Ugwuanyi method was introduced by Zelibe and Ugwuanyi (in 2019) to overcome the two stage process of standard solution which is tiring and time wasting becomes a one stage process.
